\title{Build gridlayout container for specified layout}
\usage{
grid_container(
  id = "grid-container",
  layout,
  elements,
  use_bslib_card_styles = FALSE,
  flag_mismatches = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{ID unique to this container (note that the HTML will be prefixed
with \verb{grid-} to avoid namespace clashes)}

\item{layout}{Either a markdown table representation (see
\code{\link{md_to_gridlayout}}) or a \code{gridlayout} object defining the
desired layout for your Shiny app.}

\item{elements}{Named list of the UI definitions that will be used to fill
all cells. Names must match those provided in \code{layout}.}

\item{use_bslib_card_styles}{Should the elements within the grid be given the
current bootstrap theme's card styling? Note that this setting will
override card styling for elements built with \link{\code{grid_panel()}}.
This is so you don't have to manually change styles for each card. If you
want a mixture of card styles, then you'll need to leave this as \code{FALSE}
and set styles manually on each panel.}

\item{flag_mismatches}{Should a mismatch between supplied \code{elements} ui
definitions and layout trigger a warning? In advanced cases you may want to
dynamically set your layout and sometimes omit panels.}
}
\value{
A taglist with grid elements wrapped inside a container div of class
\code{id}.
}
\description{
Builds a gridlayout within a div of specified id. Not typically called
directly but can be used to create nested grids
