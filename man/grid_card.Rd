    \item{\code{collapsible}}{Should the card be able to be collapsed (\code{TRUE} or
\code{FALSE})? Gridlayout will only show collapser if the layout allows it
(panel is entirely positioned within "auto" sized rows, and has a title).
Setting this to \code{FALSE} will mean collapsibility of the panel will never be
enabled, regardless of layout.}
    \item{\code{item_gap}}{How much space should there be between consecutive items?}
  }}

\item{title}{Character string to go across top of panel with label. If left
blank the card contents will take up entire space.}

\item{scrollable}{Should scroll-bars be added so content that is larger than
the panel can be seen?}

to turn off.}
