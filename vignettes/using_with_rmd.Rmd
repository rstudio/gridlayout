By placing the function `use_gridlayout_rmd` in the `setup` chunk of an Rmd you can define a gridlayout table using the a code chunk with the "language" set to `gridlayout`. Any markdown style table (see `md_to_gridlayout()`) will be used to setup a grid-layout for your page. Just make sure your sections are given headers corresponding to the respective grid elements (either using their name or by using the `#My header text {#custom_id}` syntax after the header.)


The following shows how you can customize the appearance of the elements of your layout using "card styles" and custom css. 


# The markdown code

The screenshot below is based on an `.Rmd` that looks like this

````
## Main

```{gridlayout}
|      |        |         |
|------|--------|---------|
|2rem  |200px   |1fr      |
|150px |header  |header   |

|120px |footer  |footer   |
```


## Sidebar

## Result


```{r, eval = FALSE}
use_gridlayout_rmd()
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("use_gridlayout_rmd_base.png")
```
