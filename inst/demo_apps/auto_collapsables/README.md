## Auto Collapsible Panels

### Purpose
Shows how `gridlayout` is smart about collapsible panels. When app is in desktop mode all the panels are relatively sized, so they are _not_ collapsible. But when the app is in mobile mode, we have auto-sized rows which then leads to gridlayout allowing the `Settings` and `Geysers!` panels to be collapsed.
