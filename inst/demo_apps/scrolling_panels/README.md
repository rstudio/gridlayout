## Scrolling panels

### Purpose
Demonstrates the ability for grid panels to scroll for content larger than
their designated size. Here we have a 600px tall plot fitting into a 400px
tall panel and a table fitting into a 200px tall panel.

_Note: currently doesn't work in RStudio's viewer pane but does work in a browser._

### Screenshots
